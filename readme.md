## Survey Setup

### Overview
To create a survey in `everyaction`we can utilize the "Online Actions" Volunteer forms. Volunteer forms provide a good starting point for a survey form because it includes the contact information in the base form and we can append our survey questions to the end of the contact form. This ensures we can tie user responses to contacts in `everyaction`. 

### Creating A Survey
Writing might be too long to be useful, for now please see the training video. An audio track will be added in the near future.

## Activist Codes
Activist codes are a core concept of Everyaction. They are tags or labels that can be applied to user profiles. This allows us to tag individuals automatically and strategically so we can query and bucket our contact lists by our defined tags to create dynamic subsets of our contacts to interact with.

### Create An Activist Code
Creating an activist code goes as follows
1. From the your `everyaction` dashboard click "Activist Codes" under the "Admin" section
2. Click "Add New Activist Code" in the top right
3. Select a relevant "Activist code Type"
4. If you have an active engagement or campaign you can link the activist code to them in the "Campaign" and "Engagement Type" fields
5. Provide a long, medium, and, short name for the activist code
6. Set a description
7. Set a script question which will be displayed to users who have this code applied to them (although im not sure under what condition or when that is)
8. Set whether the code can be assigned and removed or assigned multiple times
9. Set the "is also activist" flag (i need clarification on what this does)
10. Ensure the status is "Active"
11. Set the appropriate owner committee
12. Click "Save" go back to the activist codes page and you should see it there
